# Objective: The aim of this assignment is to assess your 
# understanding and ability to implement Python modules, 
# both built-in and custom, and to apply data handling techniques 
# using Python's data structures and error handling.

# Task 1: Your Mood Today - Problem Statement: 
# Create a Python program using a custom module that 
# asks the user how they are feeling today and responds 
# with a custom message based on the mood entered. - Code Example:

    # mood_responses.py
    # def mood_response(mood):
        # Implement your response logic here

    # main.py
    # import mood_responses
    # mood = input("How are you feeling today? ")
    # print(mood_responses.mood_response(mood))
# Expected Outcome: The program 
# should be able to take a user's mood as input 
# (e.g., happy, sad, excited) and return a corresponding custom message.

import mood_responses

mood = input("How are you? ")
response = mood_responses.mood_response(mood)
print(response)
